# 🛠️ Troubleshooting

This page covers the most common things that can go wrong when running or using Dropgate.
If you get stuck, turning on debug logs for a minute usually makes the cause obvious.

---

## 1) Quick sanity checks

- Can you reach `GET /api/info` on your server? (It should return JSON.)
- Is the feature you want actually enabled?
  - Hosted uploads: `ENABLE_UPLOAD=true`
  - Direct transfer (P2P): `ENABLE_P2P=true`
  - Web UI: `ENABLE_WEB_UI=true`
- If you’re using the Web UI in a browser, make sure you’re on **HTTPS** (localhost is the usual exception).
- If you’re behind a reverse proxy, make sure it allows request bodies large enough for upload chunks (often called something like “max body size”).
- Ensure your network/firewall allows traffic on the server port (default `52443`, or the value set by `SERVER_PORT`).

## 2) Enable debug logging

Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` on the server, reproduce the issue once, then set it back.

- `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` → detailed transfer flow
- `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` → normal operation
- `LOG_LEVEL=NONE` → no logs at all

## 3) Hosted upload issues

**Uploads are disabled / 404 on upload routes**
- Make sure `ENABLE_UPLOAD=true`.

**“File exceeds limit … MB” / “Chunk too large” / 413**
- Increase `UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`.
- If you’re behind NGINX/Caddy/etc, also check your proxy’s upload/body size limit.

**“Server out of capacity” / 507**
- Increase `UPLOAD_MAX_STORAGE_GB` (or set `0` for unlimited), and/or free disk space.

**“Integrity check failed” / “Upload incomplete”**
- Often proxy buffering/timeouts, unstable networks, or middleware touching the request body.
- Enable `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`, retry once, and check where it fails (init vs chunk vs complete).

## 4) Encryption / HTTPS issues

- Some browser features (especially WebRTC used for P2P) require a **secure context**.
- If you see missing buttons or “blocked” errors in the Web UI, run the server behind HTTPS.

## 5) P2P issues (Direct transfer)

- P2P generally requires **HTTPS** (localhost is the usual exception).
- If peers can’t connect or get stuck “connecting”:
  - Try a different network (mobile hotspot is a quick test).
  - Confirm `ENABLE_P2P=true`.
  - Try changing `P2P_STUN_SERVERS` to a different STUN provider.
  - Some networks/NATs need a **TURN** server to relay traffic (not included by default).

## 6) Rate limiting

If clients see “Too many requests”:
- Increase `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` or `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`.
- Or disable rate limiting by setting both to `0`.

## 7) Still stuck?

When asking for help, include:
- Your `GET /api/info` output
- A short snippet of server logs around the error (ideally with `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`)
- Whether you’re using a reverse proxy/tunnel (NGINX/Caddy/Cloudflare Tunnel/Tailscale)
